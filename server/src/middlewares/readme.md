# Middlewares Directory README

This directory contains all the middleware functions used across the application. Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

The middleware functions in this directory include error handling, validating request bodies, verifying tokens, etc.
