# Controllers Directory README

This directory contains all the controller functions used by the application. Each controller corresponds to a particular model (e.g., user, product, order, etc.).

Each controller file exports functions that handle HTTP requests and responses. These functions interact with the corresponding services to perform necessary CRUD operations.
